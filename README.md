# Caish Workshop - A React E-Commerce Website
This is an e-commerce website for selling woodworking products and services. Features include:
- Add, update, and delete items in your cart
- Apply a coupon to receive a discount on your purchase
- Purchase items in your cart with a credit card
- Receive an email confirmation/receipt after a purchase
- View orders made to see receipts or request a refund
- Update profile information

This website is limited in that it only has a few products listed to play around with. I would advise not using your real credit card when testing out the purchasing feature. Please use the credit card information listed in the testing strategy section below.
